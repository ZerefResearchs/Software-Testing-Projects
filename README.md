# 🛒 TutorialsNinja E-commerce Website Testing Project
## 📖 Overview

This project focuses on manual and automation testing of the TutorialsNinja Demo E-commerce Website.

It simulates testing an online shopping platform to validate the end-to-end functionality of key modules such as Login, Product Search, Cart Management, and Checkout.

The objective is to ensure the site’s core features work as expected and provide a seamless user experience.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To perform comprehensive testing of the TutorialsNinja e-commerce demo website, identify functional and usability issues, and automate key smoke test flows using Selenium WebDriver (Python).

## 🧩 Scope

### The project covers:

1. Functional Testing – Login, Search, Add to Cart, Checkout
2. Regression Testing – Ensuring recent fixes don’t affect existing features
3. Usability Testing – Evaluating navigation, UI clarity, and form validation
4. Compatibility Testing – Verifying performance on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
5. Automation Testing – Automating high-priority flows with Selenium

### Out of Scope: 
1. Backend or Database testing
2. API Testing (as the demo site doesn’t expose public APIs)
